## The mechanics of Machine Learning

* Deep learning is a subset of a more general field of artificial intelligence called machine learning, which is predicated on this idea of learning from example. In machine learning, instead of teaching a computer the a massive list rules to solve the problem, we give it a model with which it can evaluate examples and a small set of instructions to modify the model when it makes a mistake. We expect that, over time, a well-suited model would be able to solve the problem extremely accurately.

* Say our model is a function h(x,\theta) alpha	\( \alpha \ A \)	\alpha A
